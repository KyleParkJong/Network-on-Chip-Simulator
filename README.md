# NoC simulator
 - NoC Simulator in Verilog

## NoC HL
- Applied Based Routing Conformed Path (BRCP) model & Hierarchical Leader-based (HL) scheme proposed in "Multidestination Message Passing in Wormhole k-ary n-cube Networks with Base Routing Conformed Paths; Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Sanjay Singal, Ram Kesavan"
- Supporting Unicast & Multicast simultaneously
- Trying to simulate SIMBA (Scalable multI-chip-Module Based deep neural network inference Accelerator with ground referenced signaling in 16nm) architecture
- Currently working on this project March 2023 ~
